# INT-375-PYTHON-PROJECT-CRIME-MAPPING

# 🕵️‍♂️ Crime Mapping using Python

A data-driven project focused on analyzing and visualizing crime data to identify patterns, hotspots, and demographic insights using Python.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on real-world crime data from **Los Angeles (2020–present)**. The goal is to uncover trends based on time, location, crime type, victim demographics, and resolution status using Python’s data science libraries.

## 📁 Files in the Repository

- `project_final.py` – Main Python script with full EDA pipeline and visualizations.
- `cleaned_python_dataset_ca.xlsx` – Cleaned version of the original crime dataset.
- `PYTHON_REPORT_12318105_2.pdf` – Full academic report for the project.
- `Updated_Conclusion_Crime_Project.docx` – Final updated conclusion section (optional).
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage instructions.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Evening hours** (6 PM – 12 AM) show a spike in crime.
- **Summer months** have slightly higher crime rates.
- Areas like **77th Street**, **Southwest**, and **Northeast** are the most crime-prone.
- **Theft**, **burglary**, and **vehicle-related crimes** dominate.
- **Victims aged 20–40** are most affected, with a slight majority being male.
- Many cases remain **under investigation**, especially theft-related crimes.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas` – Data cleaning and manipulation
- `numpy` – Numerical analysis
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – Data visualization
- `Jupyter Notebook` / `Python 3.x`

## 📊 Project Features

- Clean and preprocess real-world crime data
- Visualize time-based crime trends
- Identify high-crime areas using area names
- Analyze top crime types and weapon usage
- Explore victim demographics (age, gender, ethnicity)
- Assess case resolution status
